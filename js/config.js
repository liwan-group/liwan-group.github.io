<p style="text-align:justify">What does it mean for a city to fall into bankruptcy? It is rare for a local government to go bankrupt but a turbulent 2023 has raised this question into the spotlight: In China, a number of cities struggling to repay their mounting debts; in the UK, Birmingham and many other councils have already officially declared effective bankruptcy. </p> 
<p style="text-align:justify"> Recognizing this phenomenon is not unique but rather a global occurrence, this essay delves into three key inquires: 1) what would happen when a city fails financially; 2) what causes such financial failures, and 3) what could cities do. Through a case study of China, marked by rapid urbanization and unprecedented economic growth but also a mounting debt crisis, this essay draws lessons from the past with the aim of laying a foundation to inform future planning and policymaking in sustainable urban development.</p>

<h3>What would happen when a city fail financially?</h3>
<p><b>1. Impacts on residents:</b></p> 
<p style="text-align:left;font-size:14px; line-height:20px;"><b>Severe public services cut.</b> In the UK, Birmingham has announced £300 million cuts of local services in early 2024, echoing similar measures in other bankruptcy cities like Nottingham. These cuts hit services include reductions in funding for vital youth programs, a matter of paramount concern for parents; arts budgets have been slashed; and streetlights have been switched off, etc., as reported by The Guardian News (2023). Examples in other countries including Yubari, Japan, show that bankruptcy leads to a sharp decline in public sector jobs and spending (Mabon & Shih, 2018). There is also an interesting argument that, city growth does not guarantee improved services; rather, if local governments exhaust funds, service quality inevitably suffers. Residents life experience may undergo dramatic change.</p>

let divChapter1_1b =`
<p style="text-align:left;font-size:14px; line-height:20px;"><b>The potential burden of higher taxes and fees, as well as lower personal disposable income.</b> Residents may also face increased tax burdens, as seen in Birminghams council tax hike of 21% over the next two years from 2024 to 2026 (BBC News, 2024), other bankruptcy councils also raised the council tax significantly including 15% rise in Croydon (BBC News, 2023) and 9.99% rise in Slough in 2023/2024 (Slough Borough Council, 2023), exacerbating financial strain on households. Especially, such cost may deepen the burden on the working class, exacerbating social disparities between different socioeconomic groups. Recent study also found a significant relationship between local government financial sustainability and the overall residents satisfaction, emphasizing the tangible impact on residents’ lives (Tran & Dollery, 2023).</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>
`;

let divChapter1_2 =`
<p><b>2. Impacts on the city:</b></p> 
<p style="text-align:left;font-size:14px; line-height:20px;"> <b>Less population and workforce.</b> A significant concern for local governments, unlike their national counterparts, is the ease of labour mobility within countries (Glaeser, 2013). Consequently, cities facing financial distress may witness a rapid exodus of residents seeking better opportunities elsewhere, leading to a decline in both the city’s workforce and the associated tax revenue base. Examples such as Detroit in the USA, burdened with a staggering debt of 18.5 billion USD, the departure of young and affluent residents to other cities has severely hampered productivity and tax revenues (McDonald, 2014), exacerbating the city’s financial woes. Similarly, in Yubari, Japan, the aftermath of bankruptcy witnessed a significant decline in population, plummeting from 116,908 in 1960 to 6,374 people in 2024 (a drop of 94.5%) (Source: Yubari City Statistical Book), further complicating the city’s economic predicament. Moreover, the loss of skilled labour compounds the issue by eroding productivity, perpetuating a cycle of economic decline. </p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>
`;

let divChapter1_2b =`
<p style="text-align:left;font-size:14px; line-height:20px;"><b>Creditworthiness and city reputation.</b> Once the credit risk of the city looms large, that bankruptcy cities would face creditworthiness plummets, making it increasingly difficult to borrow funds and attract external investments for future initiatives. Reduced public services and deteriorating infrastructure tarnish the reputation of the city, deterring potential investors and residents. The ensuing cycle of decline perpetuates a vicious cycle, further eroding the city’s resilience and vitality.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>
`;

let divChapter1_3 =`
<p><b>3. Impacts on the country/nation:</b></p> 
<p style="text-align:left;font-size:14px; line-height:20px;"> <b>Systemic Risk.</b> From a country/national perspective, localized crises may be able to spur competitionand innovation, prompting struggling cities to enact reforms and innovative policies to revitalize theireconomies. However, when multiple cities experience financial failures simultaneously, it posessignificant systemic risks, threatening national stability. The cross-industry links exacerbate theimpact of city financial failures, leading to reduced public services, government layoffs, anddeteriorating infrastructure. These factors collectively dampen economic activity, diminish consumerconfidence, and erode investor trust, heightening the risk of broader economic downturns andsystemic crises. Additionally, the failure of one city can exert pressure on others, amplifying the riskacross the nation.</p> 
<p></p>
`;


let divChapter2 =`
<h3>What causes the current financial failure?</h3>
<p><b>Trigger 1: The marginal return from infrastructure (fixed-assets) investments is decreasing</b></p>
<p>Over the past decades, it is essential to recognize that infrastructure-led economic growth has been adriving force behind China’s impressive economic expansion, fuelling substantial increases in GDP.By utilizing debt to invest in infrastructure, local governments have boosted land values and generatedsignificant tax revenues, thus stimulating overall economic activity. This trend was particularlypronounced from the late 20th century to the early 21st century, when rapid urbanization necessitatedextensive construction of roads, bridges, ports, and other vital infrastructure services.</p>

`;

let divChapter3 =`
<h3>What causes the current financial failure?</h3>
<p><b>Trigger 2: Re-structure of real estate market.</b></p>
<p>The re-structure of real estate market in recent years further added the burden to local governments. In the context of China, local governments have been increasing reliance on landrelated revenue, having a close link with real estate market through 1) selling land-use rights, and 2) real estate tax revenue.</p>

`;

let divChapter4 =`
<h3>What causes the current financial failure?</h3>
<p><b>Trigger 3: GDP-orientated cadre evaluation system</b></p>
<p>Since the economic reform in the 1980s, greater weight has been put on local economic growth, asmeasured by the local GDP growth rate. This results in a GDP-orientated cadre evaluation system inChinese local government. It should be acknowledged that, the decentralised/devolution of power hasindeed encouraged positive competition mechanism between cities, which is one of the condition forthe success in the 2000s decade.</p>
