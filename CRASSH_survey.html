            '"Mostly bad. Every time we hear about growth means either more houses or more businesses. It never seems to mean more services in any way."', 
            '"Most people do not understand that the absence of growth means decline!"',
            '"Yes and no. Overall, to me, growth means improving quality of life, which comes through: job opportunities; public infrastructure; utilities; easy & comfortable transport (I prefer *reliable* public transport) -- in Cambridge the buses are very unreliable, so I never take them, and I instead prefer walking even if its 40min of walking."',
            '"Growth in and of itself is not a bad or a good thing. It is the rate and type of growth which will determine who it benefits. A growth in the green spaces, affordable housing, educational opportunities, and stable employment in consultation with local residents could be very positive."',
            '"Bad thing, to me it means it will grow in taking up land or grow in number of people. It doesn’t mean that there will be better services or support for people living in the city. Or that there will be more social housing and wellbeing for people."',
            '"Some growth is good, but I think Cambridge is growing too fast. When places grow too fast, decisions get made without realising all the effects. "',
            '"Growth in Cambridge is mostly good. The growing population and number of businesses (particularly small businesses) helps promote the local economy and enhances Cambridges attractiveness for prospective residents and employers."',
            '"Mostly good. Selfishly, I live in the centre, and expanding the periphery of the city will increase the utility of centrally-located properties."',
            '"Good, mostly as I have children and would like more opportunities for them."',
            '"Bad. Not enough water in Cambridgeshire too support further development."',
            '"Mostly bad. Insufficient water, encroaching on green belt, infrastructure especially transport and health service can not cope. House prices and rentals too high"',
            '"Mostly a good thing.  It creates wealth and supports the broader UK economy."',
            '"Good - it is a world class centre for science and can help the UK economy grow."',
            '"Good thing, European science capital needs supporting with more homes and jobs"',
            '"Its a bad thing.  Property prices are constantly rising making it unaffordable for young people. "',
            '"Mostly bad. It’s bound to change the historic character of the city, as well as the surrounding countryside. This might be a sacrifice worth making if growth offered any major benefits, but I don’t see that it does."',
            '"Negative: loss of heritage buildings and character. "',
            '"Good thing because the rest of the world is growing and if Cambridge doesnt grow and change along with it, it may become outdated one day."',
            '"Mostly bad. Much of what is pleasant about Cambridge is that it is a small quiet city where interesting things are happening and a high percentage of people in the city are involved in intellectual endeavour, and its easy to get about. "',
            '"Growth as an increase in ‘knowledge production’ is good bringing together a critical mass of thinkers and experts is good. The consequence of this is growth in housing and services"',
            '"Mostly a good thing, Cambridge has a large tech community that can make a difference to people, but the city needs to grow to accomodate then"',
            '"Good when managed correctly. Arguments for stasis usually end up as making a place more expensive to live for low income long term residents when competing against mobile immigrants who are often dual income high wealth individuals."',
            '"Good – tbh there is not that much change, isnt it? The transformation of the station square though is very impressive. Other changes may include more restaurants and gyms, etc.? So slightly more choices."',
            '"Mainly a good thing, reflects the economic strengths of the city and sub-region.  However, it does need to be managed carefully to ensure the benefits are fairly distributed."',
            '"Bad as there is not enough water to sustain developments. It has already grown at a rate it cannot support. Other areas in the country need to be developed much more than Cambridge."',
            '"Mostly a good thing because of the need to support the engines of economic growth."',
            '"A good thing. Cambridge is globally renowned for the university and its innovative industries. The expansion of industries requires physical infrastructure and space. "',
            '"Bad. Too many flats being built"',
            '"It depends on the skill of the planners, the brilliance of the architects, the planned use of water"',
            '"Mostly bad because it is changing the character of the place, particularly with lots of soulless housing and the disappearance of green spaces at the edges, and the infrastructure cannot cope with it - water issues, roads/transport etc."',
            '"I’m quite neutral on whether it’s ‘good’ or ‘’bad’ - there are both advantages and disadvantages. However, given current issues I do think it is NECESSARY."',
            '"Bad. Historic city changing too rapidly outstripping resources of infrastructure and utilities. Rapidly changing surrounding countryside."',
            '"I see it more as an opportunity for Cambridge to experience new changes which will benefit the public not only with better employment rates but also attract many international students to share their knowledge of what they already know and receive a more better understanding of how a city grows and how it got to that stage and use it to improve the quality of life not only in Cambridge but globally too and create better opportunities for the future generation.."',
            '"Mostly a good thing. Growth generally improves the economic situation and compounds."',
            '"Growth as an increase in ‘knowledge production’ is good bringing together a critical mass of thinkers and experts is good. "',
            '"I wouldnt mind the city growing if its better planned in terms of available and affordable housing, and cimes with a growing infrastructure able to handle the increased demand of traffic and public transport. "',
            '"Cambridge is in urgent need of a better transport system and leisure facilities that can be easily reached by public transport. I live in Trumpington and transport is limited, in particular over the weekend and in the evenings. "',
            '"Solve the traffic issues. More public transport. Fewer cars please!"'

				<h4>Public Event: 4 June 2024</h4>
				<p style="text-align:justify;">As academics interested in urban development and also Cambridge residents, witnessing this question unfold in our daily lives we realised the word growth means different things to different people. For some people it is largely positive and growth brings opportunities for homes wealth and to solve existing problems cities like Cambridge face. But growth can also be threatening, much loved places change their character, environments can be damaged and what opportunities are created are not shared by everyone.</p>
				<p>&nbsp</p>
				<p style="text-align:justify;">Being academics we decided to hold a conference but we wanted to get voices of people with different opinions on what growth means for the city. More importantly we want people to tell us what growth means to them. We decided to use a survey to get as may opinions as possible and then we will invite speakers to respond. </p>
				<p>&nbsp</p>
				<a href="https://forms.gle/fVoDNHa7VP3teW3R6">Click the link to share your thoughts : )</a>
				<p>&nbsp</p>
				<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Survey Infomation: </b>This is not a consultation. We want to open up the conversation about the growth of Cambridge and what it means so we would be really grateful if you could take a few minutes to think about the following questions and share your thoughts with us. The more you can write the more it helps us understand what growth means to you, you can write in any language, formal or informal, or use block capitals with exclamation marks, or even a poem. All the data will be processed by using content analysis and text mining methods with the goal of understanding how people’s views on what growth means vary.</p>
				<!-- <font color="orange"></font> -->
				<!-- <p>&nbsp</p>
				<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Data Statement: </b>Data collected in this questionnaire is solely for academic use and will be securely stored by the event convenors. By proceeding, you agree to these data collection and storage practices. Should you wish to withdraw the information you’ve shared or have data-related concerns in the future, please contact Dr Li Wan (lw423@cam.ac.uk). </p>
				<p>&nbsp</p>
				<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>One-day Public Event</b> will be held on 4 June 2024 at Uni of Cambridge. This event would feature talks by both experts in academia and influential policy makers, addressing various aspects of Cambridge's growth. If you're interested, we would be delighted to send you an invitation to join us.</p>
				<p>&nbsp</p>
				<p style="text-align:justify;">This survey will take approximately 15 minutes of your time. You can contribute to the following questions anonymously. </p>
				<p>&nbsp</p>
				<p>Thank you for taking part and we really value your contribution to the conversation.</p>
